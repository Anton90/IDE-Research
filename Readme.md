### I am choosing **VSC** to use as an IDE.  
The download link is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

After researching several different programs to use, I came to this conclusion because of the multitude of advantages it has over most of the other ones.
Of course, this is based purely on the opinions and reviews of others.  
I'm certain that after using this for a while, I'll be able to form my own opinion. Knowing that the choice of IDE is really personal, I hope that this is the best one for me and I like using it.

#### _Advantages:_
* A lot of programming languages are supported, including the ones we'll be using most like HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, ...
* It's really easy to customize and set it up to make your coding easy and fast.
* There is a big community behind it, which means that assistance when problems arise is readily available, as well as tutorials for learning how to use this platform.
* VSC has many features that are ready to go out of the box.
* Git control is embedded in the program, which means working with git will be really easy.
* A debugger has been built in.
* ...

#### _Disadvantages:_
* It can take a while to launch, which could get frustrating after a while.
* File search can be fairly slow on large projects/files.
* VSC can take up a lot of memory to run.
